# hypermancer

A Cyberpunk terminal theme for [Hyper](www.hyper.is), inspired by Neuromancer.

## Font
Add this cool monospaced font to your system if you'd like to get a full terminal look: [Share Tech Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono?selection.family=Share+Tech+Mono).

## Credits
Hypermancer owes a debt to [Hyper Cyberpunk](https://github.com/manniefesto/hyper-cyberpunk) by manniefesto and [Hyperpunk](https://github.com/staltz/hyperpunk) by staltz.

Hypermancer started as a fork of the unfinished theme Hyper Cyberpunk. I initially just hoped to get the theme to run. Eventually the bugfix morphed into its own theme.
