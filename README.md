# hypermancer

A Cyberpunk/Neuromancer inspired terminal theme for [Hyper](www.hyper.is).

## Credits
Hypermancer is inspired by [Hyper Cyberpunk)(https://github.com/manniefesto/hyper-cyberpunk) by manniefesto. Hypermancer started as a fork of Hyper Cyberpunk, which was unfinished and would not launch in Hyper. Initially I just wanted to fix the bug, but eventually it morphed into its own theme.
