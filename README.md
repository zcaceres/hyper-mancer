# hypermancer

A Cyberpunk terminal theme for [Hyper](www.hyper.is), inspired by Neuromancer.

# Font
I recommend a cool monospaced font like: [Share Tech Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono?selection.family=Share+Tech+Mono).

## Credits
Hypermancer owes a debt to [Hyper Cyberpunk](https://github.com/manniefesto/hyper-cyberpunk) by manniefesto.

Hypermancer started as a fork of Hyper Cyberpunk, which was unfinished and would not launch in Hyper. I initially just hoped to get the theme to run. Eventually the bugfix morphed into its own theme.
